      <h3 class="callout">the first drop</h3>
      <h4 class="detail-hd">Brooklyn</h4>
      <p>Home to vibrant communities, notable landmarks, and some of the best eateries in the world, our Brooklyn drop includes 500 unique locations ready to mint. This inaugural drop includes places like Nighthawk Cinema in Park Slope, the Parachute Jump in Coney Island, and La Superior in Williamsburg. <strong>You won&#x27;t know which Place you&#x27;re getting until you mint.</strong></p>
      <p>Remember, this is still an experiment. Contract is not audited. You DO NOT have to be in or from the drop area to mint. Mint at your own risk. And have fun. If it&#x27;s not fun, don&#x27;t do it.</p>

        <h3 class="detail-hd">What in the world?!</h3>
        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>Each Place represents a named real-world geographic location with associated place information. This includes neighborhood, street address, locality, a 3D geographic coordinate with altitude, and categorical attributes such as <span class="tag">Tacos</span>, <span class="tag">Live Music</span>, or <span class="tag">Historical Landmark</span>. Each of these attributes are stored natively on chain where they can be referenced and remixed by creators.</p>

        <h3 class="detail-hd">Why on-chain?</h3>
        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>Most of the world’s mapping and place data is controlled by large corporations. It is costly to license or laden with restrictive rights.</p>
          <p>Places provides a permanent, decentralized, and immutable record of a given place and empowers creators to make art, games, maps, tools, systems, and visualizations.</p>
          <p><span class="text-highlight">Places and their attributes are stored directly on the Ethereum blockchain</span> and do not point to IPFS or other networks.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="detail-item">
        <h3 class="detail-hd">The Drops</h3>
        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>Places will be released in small drops inspired by specific neighborhoods, communities, or themes. By seeding each drop around a specific locale or community, Places is able to provide an interesting mix of representative locations in a geographically dense arrangement. This provides a unique and compelling canvas for artists and developers.</p>
          <p>The first Places drop is Brooklyn. Of course, you can imagine locales such as Austin, Paris, Miami, Los Angeles, Manhattan, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and more are on the Places radar. The ends of the earth are literally the limit.</p>

      <div class="detail-item">
        <h3 class="detail-hd">Minting Places</h3>
        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>In addition to gas, there is a nominal (in ETH terms) fee to mint a place (more on that below 👇). Mint fees are set from drop to drop. Upon each successful mint the next available Places ERC-721 token will be transferred to the minter. Only one place may be minted at a time, and you never know what place you’ll receive. Certain drops may also limit the total number of Places a wallet address is able to mint. <span class="text-highlight">The Places contract is NOT audited so mint at your own risk.</span></p>
          <p>For now, new drops can be minted from the Places contract directly. In the future we hope to offer wallet connect minting from this website.</p>

        <h3 class="detail-hd">PlacesDAO, Proceeds, + Placehodlers</h3>
        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>Immutably storing geographic information on-chain will require a meaningful investment of resources over time.</p>
          <p>To that end, the PlacesDAO treasury receives 75% of ETH proceeds from each drop. The treasury will be used to fund contract fees for future drops. In this way a virtuous cycle can fuel expansion of Places to new neighborhoods and cities. PlacesDAO also aims to fund projects that benefit the Places ecosystem as a whole.</p>
          <p>The remaining 25% ETH is transferred via contract to a unique Neighborhood treasury (defined per each drop) where it will be disbursed to one or more local projects at the decision of PlacesDAO. Here&#x27;s <a href="https://placesdao.notion.site/Neighborhood-Grants-0514a53a3d874fc088cb9dc9f9d6334b">how neighborhood grants will work</a>.</p>
          <p>Each Place token is an irrevocable member of PlacesDAO. As the project grows and membership diversifies, DAO members (Placehodlers?) will become the primary governing body of the Places project. </p>

              <li>An API for searching and discovering Places</li>

              <li>PFP + Places remixes</li>
              <li>Systems that provide verifiable proof-of-location, proof-of-sale, or proof-of-attendance at Places</li>

        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>The “Grounders”* are the team at <a href="https://twitter.com/gowalla" target="_blank">Gowalla</a>, a gaming company exploring the space where our digital and physical worlds collide. Grounders believe in the power of communities working together and are responsible for creating and seeding the Places project. Gowalla’s own products plan to support Places as a protocal.</p>
          <p>Because 100% of the ETH proceeds from Places are divided between the PlacesDAO and neighborhood treasuries, Gowalla has chosen to receive Place tokens as compensation. Every 20th Place (beginning with a random ID for each drop) will be automatically minted and sent to the Grounders multisig.</p>
